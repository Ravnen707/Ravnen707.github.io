### Welcome to my page where i will show about myselff and what i like!

First things first. Im a 23 year old student at: Zealand Erhvervsakademi Næstved.
I'm that lucky that i only live 10min walk to and from school.
But i havent always lived in Næstved. I used to live in a small village called Dalby where I also went to school. But around when i turned 15 or so i moved to Haslev with my mom and sister and stepfather. My real allready lived in Næstved at this point. So yeah as you can guess. my parents are divorced. Welp in Haslev i lived all the way throught the rest of my school time through highschool. 
After all that i took 1 year off to work were i also moved to Næstved to live with my dad because of money problems and so on. So now school wise we're up to were I am today.
